Each of the 3 Jupyter Notebooks contains one of the 3 codebooks to complete.

The progress images serve as proof on my account, while the notebooks have all relevant code.
'plotter' failed locally, but worked on the PennyLane site. In 'plotted_images', you can find
the results of all 'plotter' calls.

Over the course of the codebook, I learned a lot that explained most of the code excerpts
I had found when following the tutorials in Tasks 2 & 3. It was very low-level, but understanding
the building blocks helped make it make more sense. Overall, I did learn a lot, and plan to 
continue completing the Pennylane codebooks.
